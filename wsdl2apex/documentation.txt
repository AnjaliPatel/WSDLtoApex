-ByteArray InputStream in: gets the bytes in the wsdl file
-In XmlInputStream()
    -parser.setFeature(XmlPullParser.FEATURE_PROCESS_NAMESPACE,True);
     processing of namespace set to true.   
     parser:MXParser: implements XMLPullParser
-In wsdlParser
	-sets the XMLInputStream to be XMLInputStream just created
	-wsdlParser.setInput(in, "UTF-8"):  in: wsdl byte array
	-use private variable in, the xmlInputStream that is the pull parser 
	 goes into the XMParser and creates an InputStreamReqader
	
The wsdl's target namespace gets mapped as the package (the overall class created).
A complex type becomes a class within the package.  
Each element is a public field in the class.  
The wsdl port name maps to a class where there will be a method to use for callouts.  
Operations in the wsdl maps to a public method.
